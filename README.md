# MCF-app
https://cyhung.shinyapps.io/MCFcalculator/

This app provide online tool to calculate methane conversion factor(MCF) with air/manure temperature input. Developed by Chih-Yu Hung in the research team including Andrew VanderZaag, Ward Smith, and Brian Grant at Agricutlure, Agri-Food, Canada.

The calculation is based on 2019 IPCC Refinement, but a slight revision, i.e. only one-time maure removal in Aug-December would cause damping effect. 
The other details please read Chapter 10, Emissions from livestock and manure managment in 2019 IPCC Refinement.

There are minor bugs need to fix. 
1. no unit in the plot
2. Letters other than "y" and "n" are treated as "n" without warning. 

Next version will fix the bugs and develop a Canada map so user can select a place in Canada to know the MCF value.
